## Service Reliability Notice

**Important:** DeepSeek's translation service may occasionally experience instability or downtime, which could result in translation failures. This is beyond our control as it depends on DeepSeek's infrastructure.

### Alternative Solutions

If you experience frequent service interruptions or need more reliable translation services, you can extend this plugin to integrate with other translation providers:

#### Recommended Alternative Services:

1. **Google Translate API**
   - High reliability and uptime
   - Extensive language support
   - Well-documented API

2. **Microsoft Translator**
   - Enterprise-grade reliability
   - Good pricing model
   - Strong neural translation quality

3. **Amazon Translate**
   - AWS infrastructure reliability
   - Pay-as-you-go pricing
   - Good integration with other AWS services

4. **OpenAI GPT API**
   - High-quality contextual translation
   - Good for creative and marketing content
   - More expensive but higher quality

#### Extending the Plugin

To integrate additional translation services:

1. **Create a new translation engine class** in `/inc/TranslationEngines/`
2. **Extend the base `TRP_Machine_Translator` class**
3. **Implement required methods:**
   - `send_request()` - Handle API communication
   - `translate_array()` - Process translation requests
   - `get_api_key()` - Retrieve API credentials
   - `check_api_key_validity()` - Validate API key

4. **Register your new engine** in `/inc/ServiceProvider/RegisterMachineTranslationEngines.php`

5. **Add configuration fields** for the new service's API settings

Example structure for a new translation engine:

```php
class CustomTranslationEngine extends TRP_Machine_Translator {
    const ENGINE_KEY = 'custom_translate';
    
    public function send_request($source_language, $language_code, $strings_array) {
        // Implement API call to your chosen service
    }
    
    public function translate_array($new_strings, $target_language_code, $source_language_code) {
        // Process and return translated strings
    }
    
    // ... other required methods
}
```

This modular approach allows you to maintain multiple translation providers and switch between them based on availability and requirements.
